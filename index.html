                <p class="answer" id="java">JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language
                    primarily used for enhancing the interactivity of web pages. It was originally developed by
                    Netscape as a means to add interactive and dynamic elements to websites.

                <p class="answer" id="operator">Operators are symbols or keywords that perform operations on one or
                    more operands. Operators allow you to manipulate data, perform calculations, compare values, and
                    control the flow of your program.

                    holds
                    data or values. Variables are fundamental to programming languages like JavaScript because
                    they
                    allow developers to store, manipulate, and retrieve data during the execution of a program.

                    Variable naming conventions refer to guidelines and rules that developers follow when naming
                    variables in programming languages like JavaScript. Consistent and meaningful variable names
                    enhance code readability, maintainability, and understanding.

                <p class="answer" id="function">A function is a named block of code that performs a specific
                    task or
                    operation. Functions are fundamental building blocks in most programming languages,
                    including
                    JavaScript. Functions are essential for structuring and organizing code in JavaScript and
                    other
                    programming languages.

                <p class="answer" id="method">A method is a kind of function that is called on something.A method is
                    a function that is associated with an object. Methods are defined as properties of objects and
                    are used to perform actions or provide functionality related to that object.

                    or
                    invoked. These values are received by the function through its parameters, which act as
                    placeholders for the incoming arguments. Arguments allow functions to perform tasks with
                    different inputs dynamically.

                    receive values (arguments) when the function is called or invoked. Parameters allow functions to
                    accept inputs dynamically and perform tasks based on those inputs.

                    the
                    function should output or "return" when it is called and executed. It allows functions to
                    compute a result and send that result back to where the function was called from.

                <p class="answer" id="ch-method">Chaining methods refers to the technique of calling multiple
                    methods on an object in a single, fluent statement. This approach is facilitated by methods that
                    return the object itself (this) after performing their operation, allowing subsequent methods to
                    be called sequentially on the same object. Chaining methods is commonly used in JavaScript to
                    write concise and readable code.

                    boolean can have one of two possible values: true or false. Booleans are often used in
                    conditional statements and logical operations to control the flow of a program based on
                    whether
                    certain conditions are true or false.

                    assigned to it. undefined is also returned by functions that do not explicitly return a
